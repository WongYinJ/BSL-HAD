Implementation of the algorithm proposed in the paper {Y. Wang, W. Li, Y. Gui, H. Xie and L. Zhang, "A Generalized Non-convex Surrogated Framework for Anomaly Detection on Blurred Hyperspectral Images," in IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, doi: 10.1109/TIP.2025.3568745.}

Two demos are provided in the project. demo.m applies the algorithm to non-blurred HSI; demo_blurred.m applies the algorithm to blurred HSI;

Remember to decompress the tensor_toolbox_2.5.zip file in the path ..\Tools\ before usage.
